# 🚀 Workflow Migration Guide - Unified Pipeline

**Goal:** Replace 11 separate workflows with 1 unified pipeline  
**Benefits:** Easier maintenance, faster execution, clearer status  
**Status:** Ready to execute

---

## 📋 What We're Creating

### **NEW: One Unified Workflow**
`lokifi-unified-pipeline.yml` - The ultimate CI/CD pipeline

**Contains all jobs:**
- 🎨 Frontend Tests & Coverage
- 🔒 Frontend Security
- 🐍 Backend Tests & Lint
- ♿ Accessibility Tests (conditional)
- 📋 API Contract Tests (conditional)
- 📸 Visual Regression (conditional, label-triggered)
- 🔗 Integration Tests (conditional)
- 🎯 Quality Gate (final validation)
- 📚 Documentation (main branch only)

### **OLD: 11 Separate Workflows**
All redundant and will be replaced

---

## ✅ Migration Steps

### Step 1: Test the New Workflow (Safety First!)

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b unified-pipeline-test

# Add the new workflow
git add .github/workflows/lokifi-unified-pipeline.yml

# Commit and push
git commit -m "feat(ci): add unified CI/CD pipeline

Consolidates all CI/CD jobs into one workflow:
- Frontend testing and security
- Backend testing and linting
- Optional specialized tests (a11y, visual, API)
- Quality gate for final validation
- Documentation generation

Benefits:
- Single workflow to maintain
- Parallel job execution
- Clear dependencies
- Conditional jobs
- Comprehensive PR comments"

git push origin unified-pipeline-test
```

### Step 2: Create Test PR

```bash
# Create a test PR to verify the workflow
# Go to GitHub and create PR from unified-pipeline-test to main
# Watch the workflow run
# Verify all jobs execute correctly
```

### Step 3: Backup Old Workflows

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Create backup branch (just in case)
git checkout -b workflow-backup-pre-migration
git push origin workflow-backup-pre-migration
git checkout main
```

### Step 4: Remove Old Workflows

```bash
# Delete redundant workflows
git rm .github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml  # Will be replaced
git rm .github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml        # Redundant
git rm .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml         # Integrated
git rm .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml              # Redundant
git rm .github/workflows/ci.yml                 # Redundant
git rm .github/workflows/security-tests.yml     # Redundant
git rm .github/workflows/accessibility.yml      # Integrated
git rm .github/workflows/api-contracts.yml      # Integrated
git rm .github/workflows/visual-regression.yml  # Integrated
git rm .github/workflows/integration-ci.yml     # Integrated

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "chore(ci): remove old workflows, replaced by unified pipeline

Removed 10 redundant workflow files:
- test-and-quality.yml (replaced by unified)
- frontend-ci.yml (redundant)
- backend-ci.yml (integrated)
- ci-cd.yml, ci.yml (duplicates)
- security-tests.yml (integrated)
- accessibility.yml (integrated, conditional)
- api-contracts.yml (integrated, conditional)
- visual-regression.yml (integrated, label-triggered)
- integration-ci.yml (integrated, conditional)

New unified pipeline provides:
- All functionality in one place
- Better job orchestration
- Faster execution (parallel jobs)
- Easier maintenance
- Clearer status reporting"
```

### Step 5: Merge to Main

```bash
# Merge the unified-pipeline-test PR first
# This activates the new workflow

# Then push the cleanup
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Job Execution Logic

### **Always Run (Every PR/Push):**
- ✅ Frontend Tests & Coverage
- ✅ Frontend Security
- ✅ Backend Tests & Lint
- ✅ Quality Gate

### **PR Only:**
- 🔄 Accessibility Tests
- 🔄 API Contract Tests
- 🔄 Integration Tests

### **Label-Triggered:**
- 🏷️ Visual Regression (needs `visual-test` label)

### **Main Branch Only:**
- 📚 Documentation Generation

---

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (11 Workflows)
```
Status Page Shows:
✅ Frontend CI
✅ Backend CI
❌ CI/CD Pipeline
❌ CI
❌ Security Tests
❌ Accessibility
❌ API Contracts
❌ Visual Regression
❌ Integration CI
✅ test-and-quality
✅ Code Scanning

Result: Confusing, many failures
```

### After (1 Workflow)
```
Status Page Shows:
✅ Lokifi Unified CI/CD Pipeline
  ├─ ✅ Frontend Tests
  ├─ ✅ Frontend Security
  ├─ ✅ Backend Tests
  ├─ ✅ Quality Gate
  └─ (Optional jobs as needed)

Result: Clear, clean, professional
```

## 💡 Advanced Features in New Workflow

### 1. **Parallel Execution**
```yaml
Jobs run in parallel:
- frontend-test (parallel with)
- frontend-security (parallel with)
- backend-test

Then waits for all to complete before:
- quality-gate
```

### 2. **Conditional Jobs**
```yaml
accessibility:
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  
visual-regression:
  if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'visual-test')
  
documentation:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

### 3. **Job Dependencies**
```yaml
quality-gate:
  needs: [frontend-test, frontend-security, backend-test]
  
documentation:
  needs: [quality-gate]
```

### 4. **Comprehensive PR Comments**
Each job posts its own comment:
- 🎨 Frontend Test Results (with coverage table)
- 🔒 Frontend Security Scan (with vulnerability table)
- 🎯 Quality Gate Final Status (summary)

---

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Add More Jobs
```yaml
mobile-test:
  name: 📱 Mobile Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [frontend-test]
  steps:
    - # Your mobile testing steps
```

### Add More Conditions
```yaml
performance:
  name: ⚡ Performance Tests
  if: |
    github.event_name == 'pull_request' && 
    contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'performance')
```

### Modify Thresholds
```yaml
env:
  COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 10  # Increase as coverage improves
  MAX_HIGH_VULNS: 5       # Lower as security improves
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If Backend Tests Fail
```bash
# Backend directory path might be wrong
# Check: apps/backend vs backend
# Update working-directory in workflow
```

### If Jobs Don't Run in Parallel
```yaml
# Check job dependencies - remove unnecessary "needs:"
# Jobs without "needs" run in parallel
```

### If Documentation Doesn't Deploy
```bash
# Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled
# Settings → Pages → Source: gh-pages branch
```

---

## 🎉 Expected Results

### After Migration:
- ✅ **1 workflow file** instead of 11
- ✅ **Faster execution** (parallel jobs)
- ✅ **Clearer status** (single workflow badge)
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** (one place to update)
- ✅ **Better organized** (logical job grouping)
- ✅ **More flexible** (conditional jobs)
- ✅ **Professional** (industry best practice)

### Time Savings:
- **Before:** 5-10 min to update workflows (11 files)
- **After:** 1-2 min to update (1 file)
- **Maintenance reduction:** 80%

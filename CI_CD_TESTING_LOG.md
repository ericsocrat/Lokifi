## 📊 Live Verification

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions ✅
**URL:** https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/actions

**What to look for:**
- ✅ Workflow run appears: "docs(ci): add CI/CD quick start guide"
- ✅ Shows 3 jobs (test, security, quality-gate)
- ✅ All jobs start running
- ✅ Jobs run in parallel (test + security)
- ✅ Quality gate waits for both

### Step 2: Create Pull Request
**URL:** https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/pull/new/test-ci-cd

**What to verify:**
- PR can be created from test-ci-cd → main
- PR shows checks in progress
- Workflow runs again for PR event
- PR gets commented with test results
- PR gets commented with security results

### Step 3: Verify PR Comments
**Expected Comments:**

#### Comment 1: Test Results
```markdown
## 🧪 Test Results

**Status:** ✅ Tests completed

### Coverage Report
| Metric | Percentage | Covered/Total |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Statements | 13.7% | 123/897 |
| Branches | 12.3% | 45/365 |
| Functions | 10.5% | 78/742 |

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

### Non-Blocking Issues:
1. **Test Runner Warning:** Pre-push hook has a ValidateSet issue with `-Quick` parameter
   - Status: Non-blocking (tests still run)
   - Fix: Update test-runner.ps1 ValidateSet

2. **Quality Gate Failure:** Pre-commit shows "SOME PROTECTION GATES FAILED"
   - Status: Non-blocking (marked as warning, commit allowed)
   - Cause: CursorPosition exception in enhanced protection
   - Fix: Update enhanced-ci-protection.ps1

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks run locally (separate from CI/CD)
- ✅ GitHub Actions runs independently
- ✅ Both systems work in parallel
- ✅ CI/CD is authoritative source of truth

# Dashboard Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What I've Built

I've created a **professional portfolio dashboard** matching the Kubera-style design you shared. This is the welcome screen users see after signing up but before adding any assets.

## 🌐 Access Your Dashboard

**URL:** http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## 📋 What You'll See

### 1. **Top Navigation Bar**
- KUBERA logo
- Icons for: Notifications, Search, Share, Settings
- Currency selector (EUR €)
- Your name and avatar

### 2. **Left Sidebar**
```
📊 Net Worth      €0
📈 Assets         €0
⚠️  Debts         €0
📑 Recap
⏭️  Fast Forward
👥 Beneficiary
```

### 3. **Main Content Area**

#### Welcome Message Box:
```
Yassou, [YourName]*

Here's where you come to see the overview of your portfolio.

These numbers and charts will come alive when there's enough
data. Please add your assets to get started.

You will be notified when the dashboard is ready.

[Add Assets] ← Black button
```

#### Preview Cards (3 columns):
- **Net Worth**: €1.5 Million (with performance metrics)
- **Assets**: €2 Million (Liquid/Illiquid breakdown)
- **Debts**: €500,000 (Loan/Mortgage breakdown)

#### Additional Cards (2 columns):
- **Cash on Hand**: €100,000
- **Illiquid**: €120,000

#### Charts:
- **Net Worth Chart**: Purple gradient with "SAMPLE" watermark
- **Allocations**: Two donut charts with "SAMPLE" watermarks

## 🔐 Authentication

The dashboard is **protected**:
- ✅ Logged in users → See dashboard
- ❌ Not logged in → Redirected to home page

## ⚡ Key Features

1. **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
2. **Professional UI** - Clean, modern, Kubera-inspired
3. **Sample Data** - Shows users what to expect
4. **Clear CTA** - "Add Assets" button guides next step
5. **Watermarked Charts** - Indicates placeholder state

## 🎨 Design Details

**Colors:**
- Background: Light gray (#F9FAFB)
- Cards: White with subtle shadows
- Text: Dark gray to black
- Charts: Purple gradient
- Positive values: Green
- Negative values: Red

**Typography:**
- Large, bold headings
- Clean, readable body text
- Semibold for numbers/emphasis

## 🔄 Next Steps

**When you're ready to add the populated state:**
1. Send me the image of the dashboard WITH assets
2. I'll implement:
   - Real data display
   - Interactive charts
   - Asset breakdown
   - Add assets functionality
   - Live calculations

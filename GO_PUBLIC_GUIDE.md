## Part 1: Making the Repository Public

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Go to Repository Settings
🔗 **Direct Link:** https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/settings

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (top right)

---

#### 2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
- Located at the very **bottom** of the settings page
- Has a red border around it
- Contains repository visibility options

---

#### 3. Click "Change repository visibility"
- First button in the Danger Zone section
- Will open a confirmation dialog

---

#### 4. Select "Make public"
- A dialog will appear with options:
  - **Make public** ← Select this
  - Make private
  - Make internal

---

#### 5. Read and Acknowledge
The dialog will show warnings:

```
⚠️  Making this repository public will:
   • Allow anyone to see your code
   • Appear in GitHub search results
   • Allow anyone to fork your repository
   • Make commit history public
   • GitHub Secrets remain encrypted and private
```

**Don't worry!** We've verified:
- ✅ No secrets in code
- ✅ No .env files committed
- ✅ Proper .gitignore in place
- ✅ License file protects copyright

---

#### 6. Type "Lokifi" to Confirm
- You must type the repository name exactly: **Lokifi**
- Case-sensitive!
- This prevents accidental changes

---

#### 7. Click "I understand, make this repository public"
- Final confirmation button
- Takes effect immediately

---

#### 8. Verify It Worked
After clicking:
1. You'll see a green success banner
2. Repository badge will change from 🔒 Private to 🌍 Public
3. GitHub Actions will start running automatically!

---

### What Happens Immediately After:

**Within 30 seconds:**
- ✅ Repository becomes searchable on GitHub
- ✅ Anyone can view code (but NOT your GitHub Secrets!)
- ✅ GitHub Actions gets unlimited minutes
- ✅ PR #20 checks will start running automatically!

**Within 2-5 minutes:**
- ✅ PR #20 checks complete (Test & Coverage, Security Scan, Quality Gate)
- ✅ Bot comments appear on PR #20
- ✅ You can merge PR #20!

---

## Part 2: Setting Up Branch Protection

**Why?** Branch protection prevents accidental direct pushes to main and enforces quality standards.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. Go to Branch Settings
🔗 **Direct Link:** https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/settings/branches

Or manually:
1. Repository Settings
2. Click **"Branches"** in left sidebar

---

#### 2. Find "Branch protection rules"
- Section in the middle of the page
- Click **"Add branch protection rule"** button

---

#### 3. Configure Protection for `main` Branch

**Branch name pattern:**
```
main
```

**Required Settings (Recommended):**

##### ✅ Protection Rules to Enable:

**1. Require a pull request before merging**
- [x] Check this box
- Then check:
  - [x] **Require approvals** (set to 0 for solo projects, 1+ for teams)
  - [x] **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
  - [x] **Require review from Code Owners** (optional, for teams)

**2. Require status checks to pass before merging**
- [x] Check this box
- Then check:
  - [x] **Require branches to be up to date before merging**

- **Add status checks:** (Click "Add checks")
  Search for and add:
  - `Test & Quality Pipeline / 🧪 Test & Coverage`
  - `Test & Quality Pipeline / 🔒 Security Scan`
  - `Test & Quality Pipeline / 🎯 Quality Gate`

**3. Require conversation resolution before merging**
- [x] Check this box
- Forces all PR comments to be resolved before merge

**4. Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
- [x] Check this box (unless you're the owner and want override power)

**5. Allow force pushes**
- [ ] **LEAVE UNCHECKED** (prevents history rewriting)

**6. Allow deletions**
- [ ] **LEAVE UNCHECKED** (prevents accidental branch deletion)

---

#### 4. Optional: Add Protection for `develop` Branch

Repeat steps 2-3 but use:
```
develop
```

Same rules as main branch.

---

#### 5. Save Changes
- Scroll to bottom
- Click **"Create"** button
- Rules take effect immediately

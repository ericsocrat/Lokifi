## 🚀 Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review Current Tests**
   ```bash
   cd apps/frontend
   npm run test
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

2. **Identify Coverage Gaps**
   - Review coverage reports
   - List untested components
   - Prioritize critical paths

3. **Choose Tools**
   - Decide on visual testing tool
   - Decide on contract testing approach
   - Decide on E2E framework (recommend Playwright)

4. **Start with Task 1**
   - Begin with accessibility testing
   - Quick win, high impact
   - Sets pattern for other tasks

---

## 💬 Decision Points

### Decision 1: Visual Testing Tool
**Options:**
- **Percy.io** - Paid, excellent UX, cloud-based
- **Chromatic** - Storybook integration, paid
- **BackstopJS** - Free, self-hosted, more setup
- **Playwright** - Free, built-in, requires coding

**Recommendation:** Start with Playwright (free, flexible), upgrade to Percy if needed

### Decision 2: Contract Testing Approach
**Options:**
- **Pact** - Consumer-driven, great for microservices
- **OpenAPI** - Spec-driven, good for REST APIs
- **Newman** - Collection-based, familiar if using Postman

**Recommendation:** OpenAPI if API spec exists, otherwise Pact

### Decision 3: Integration Tests Location
**Options:**
- **Integrate into unified pipeline** - Single workflow
- **Keep separate** - Dedicated integration workflow

**Recommendation:** Integrate into unified pipeline for simplicity

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Time Estimation** - Tasks may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation:** Start with smaller tasks, adjust timeline

2. **Tool Learning Curve** - New tools require learning
   - **Mitigation:** Use documentation, examples, start simple

3. **Test Flakiness** - E2E tests can be flaky
   - **Mitigation:** Use best practices, retries, good selectors

### Medium Risks
1. **Coverage Targets** - 80% may be ambitious
   - **Mitigation:** Adjust target based on progress

2. **CI/CD Time** - More tests = longer execution
   - **Mitigation:** Optimize, parallelize, conditional execution

### Low Risks
1. **Tool Costs** - Some tools require paid plans
   - **Mitigation:** Start with free options

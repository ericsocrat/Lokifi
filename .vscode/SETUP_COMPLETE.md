# ✅ Extension Setup Complete - Action Items

## 🎉 What You Just Installed

✅ **Vitest Explorer** - Visual test runner for unit tests  
✅ **Playwright Test** - E2E test debugging and execution  
✅ **Coverage Gutters** - Inline code coverage visualization  
✅ **Console Ninja** - Inline console.log output  
✅ **Import Cost** - Bundle size warnings  

---

## 🚀 Required Actions (Do These Now)

### 1. **Install Playwright Browsers** 🔴 CRITICAL
Playwright needs browser binaries to run E2E tests.

```powershell
cd apps/frontend
npx playwright install
```

**Estimated time**: 2-3 minutes  
**Download size**: ~400MB (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

---

### 2. **Reload VS Code Window** 🔴 REQUIRED
Activate the new extensions and settings.

**Two options:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → Type "Reload Window" → Enter
- **OR** Close and reopen VS Code

---

### 3. **Verify Test Explorer** ✅ RECOMMENDED
Check that tests appear in the sidebar.

**Steps:**
1. Click the beaker icon 🧪 in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
2. You should see:
   - **Vitest** section with your unit tests
   - **Playwright** section with E2E tests
3. If tests don't appear, reload window again

---

### 4. **Generate Coverage Report** ✅ RECOMMENDED
Create initial coverage data for Coverage Gutters.

```powershell
cd apps/frontend
npm run test:coverage
```

**Then activate Coverage Gutters:**
1. Open any test file (e.g., `tests/lib/webVitals.test.ts`)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Coverage Gutters: Display Coverage"
3. You'll see green/red gutters indicating coverage

---

### 5. **Test Console Ninja** ✅ OPTIONAL
Verify inline console output is working.

**Steps:**
1. Start frontend dev server: `npm run dev` (in `apps/frontend`)
2. Open any `.ts` or `.tsx` file
3. Add `console.log('test')` somewhere
4. Save the file
5. You should see output as inline comments

3. Open Output panel → Filter to "Vitest" to see logs

### Issue: Coverage not showing
**Solution:**
1. Generate coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
2. Verify file exists: `apps/frontend/coverage/lcov.info`
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+7` to toggle display
4. Click "Watch" in status bar

### Issue: Playwright tests fail
**Solution:**
1. Install browsers: `npx playwright install`

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Watch Mode
Keep tests running in watch mode during development:
```powershell
npm test  # Vitest watch mode (auto-reruns on save)
```

### Tip 2: Coverage on Save
Enable coverage watch mode:
1. Generate coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
2. Click "Watch" in status bar (Coverage Gutters)
3. Coverage updates automatically as you save

### Tip 3: Playwright Trace Viewer
When tests fail, view detailed traces:
```powershell
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

### Tip 4: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Write test first (will fail - red)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (green)
3. Refactor code (keep green)
4. Watch coverage increase! 📈

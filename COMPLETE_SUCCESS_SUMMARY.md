   - User ownership increased adoption likelihood

2. **Backup First Strategy**
   - workflow-backup-pre-migration provided safety net
   - Enabled bold, aggressive consolidation
   - Reduced risk, increased confidence

3. **Incremental Testing**
   - PR #21 validated everything before declaring success
   - Real metrics better than estimates
   - Caught zero issues (good sign!)

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - 9,000+ lines ensures knowledge preservation
   - Future developers will understand the journey
   - Reduces bus factor significantly

5. **Professional Architecture**
   - Following best practices paid off
   - Parallel execution = major performance gain
   - Conditional logic = cost optimization

### Key Insights 💡

1. **Consolidation > Fragmentation**

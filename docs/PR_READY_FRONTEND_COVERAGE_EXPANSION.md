## Frontend Testing Expansion - Batches 1-5

### Overview
Comprehensive frontend testing expansion adding store tests, component tests, and infrastructure improvements. This PR represents 5 batches of systematic testing work with a focus on quality and maintainability.

### 🎯 What's Included

#### Batch 5: Simple Component Tests (Latest Work)
- **6 components fully tested**: ReportPortal, AlertPortal, ReactQueryProvider, DrawingSettings, LabelsLayer, PluginManager
- **126 comprehensive tests**: All passing at 100%
- **Bug fix**: Corrected ReactQueryProvider import path (@/src/lib → @/lib)
- **Documentation**: Complete summary in BATCH_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md

#### Batches 1-4: Foundation Work
- **11 store tests**: 100% coverage on core stores
  - alertsStore, drawStore, drawingStore, indicatorStore
  - marketDataStore, multiChartStore, paneStore
  - pluginSettingsStore, symbolStore, timeframeStore, watchlistStore

- **13+ component tests**:
  - ProjectBar, SelectionToolbar, ShareBar
  - MarketStats, QuickStats, KeyboardShortcuts
  - ProfileDropdown
  - Dashboard components

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Enhanced vitest configuration
  - Visual regression test baselines
  - Comprehensive testing documentation

### 📈 Impact

**Before**:
- Frontend coverage: ~10%
- Limited component testing
- Store functionality untested

**After**:
- Frontend coverage: 20.4%
- 82 test files passing
- Comprehensive store coverage
- Well-established testing patterns

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
1. **ReactQueryProvider**: Fixed incorrect import path that didn't match vitest alias configuration

### 🔧 Changes to Production Code
- `ReactQueryProvider.tsx`: Import path fix
- `ProjectBar.tsx`: Minor refactoring for testability
- `MarketStats.tsx`, `QuickStats.tsx`: Testability improvements
- `drawStore.tsx`: Minor refactoring
- `featureFlags.ts`: New utility module

### ✅ Quality Assurance

**All Quality Gates Passed**:
- ✅ Tests: 82/82 passing
- ✅ Coverage: 20.4% frontend (up from ~10%)
- ✅ Lint: Clean (only test file `any` warnings)
- ✅ Security: No vulnerabilities
- ✅ Performance: Build time optimal

**Testing Approach**:
- Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases
- Self-documenting test names
- Established reusable patterns
- Proper mocking strategies

### 📚 Documentation

**Included Documentation**:
- `BATCH_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`: Detailed Batch 5 results
- `COMPLETE_FRONTEND_AUDIT.md`: Infrastructure assessment
- `COMPONENT_BATCH_1_COMPLETE.md`: Component testing phase 1
- `COMPONENT_BATCH_2_COMPLETE.md`: Component testing phase 2
- `COMPONENT_BATCH_3_COMPLETE.md`: Component testing phase 3
- `BATCH_4_INFRASTRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md`: Config analysis
- Multiple store test summaries

### 🎨 Test Patterns Established

**Portal Components**:
```typescript
- Mock child components
- Test window event listeners
- Verify cleanup on unmount
```

**Provider Components**:
```typescript
- Minimal mocks for complex dependencies
- Test children pass-through
- Environment-based rendering
```

**UI Components**:
```typescript
- Store integration testing
- User interaction flows
- Accessibility compliance
```

**Store Tests**:
```typescript
- State management verification
- Action/reducer testing
- Side effect handling
```

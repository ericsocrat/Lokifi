## 🔧 What Each Fix Does

### 1. JWT Secret Configuration
**Problem:** Tests failed because JWT secret wasn't configured in CI environment
```
ValueError: No JWT secret configured. Set LOKIFI_JWT_SECRET or JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable.
```

**Solution:** Added to workflow jobs:
```yaml
env:
  LOKIFI_JWT_SECRET: test-secret-for-ci-pipeline
```

**Why This Works:**
- Backend code requires JWT secret for authentication/authorization
- Tests import dependencies that check for this configuration
- Setting it in the workflow env provides it to all steps in the job

### 2. PYTHONPATH Configuration
**Problem:** Python couldn't find the `app` module when importing
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```

**Solution:** Added PYTHONPATH to workflow:
```yaml
- name: 🔧 Set PYTHONPATH
  run: echo "PYTHONPATH=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/apps/backend" >> $GITHUB_ENV

# Also prepended to pytest commands
PYTHONPATH=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/apps/backend pytest ...
```

### 3. Syntax Errors in ai.py
**Problem:** f-strings with nested dictionaries caused parse errors
```python
# ❌ WRONG
yield f"data: {json.dumps({'key': 'value'})}\n\n"
```

**Solution:** Extract dictionary first:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT
data = {'key': 'value'}
yield f"data: {json.dumps(data)}\n\n"
```

### 4. faker Version
**Problem:** Version 34.3.0 doesn't exist in PyPI

**Solution:** Changed to 30.8.2 (stable for Python 3.11+)

   - Missing test isolation/mocking for API calls

---

## Detailed Test Breakdown

### ✅ Passing Tests (6 tests)

**Tests That Don't Require Backend:**
- Unit tests for chart utilities
- Type definition tests
- Basic component rendering tests (isolated)

### ❌ Failing Tests (71 tests)

#### Category 1: Backend Connection Failures (50+ tests)

**Error Pattern:**
```
TypeError: fetch failed
AggregateError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:8000
  - connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:8000
  - connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8000
```

**Affected Test Categories:**
1. **API Contract Tests** (`tests/api/contracts/`)
   - Auth contract tests (4 tests)
   - OHLC contract tests (7 tests)
   - WebSocket contract tests (assumed failing)

2. **Security Tests** (`tests/security/`)
   - Input validation tests (12 tests)
   - Unicode normalization
   - File upload validation
   - CSP headers validation
   - Security headers validation

**Root Cause:** Tests attempt to make real HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000` but:
- Backend server not running during test execution
- No mock server configured
- No API mocking layer (MSW, nock, etc.)

#### Category 2: State Management Failures (4 tests)

**Multi-Chart Store Tests** (`tests/unit/multiChart.test.tsx`)

1. **Layout Change Test:**
```
AssertionError: expected '1x1' to be '2x2'
Expected: "2x2"
Received: "1x1"
```

2. **Symbol Linking Test:**
```
AssertionError: expected false to be true
- Expected: true
+ Received: false
```

3. **Timeframe Linking Test:**
```
AssertionError: expected false to be true
```

4. **Cursor Linking Test:**
```
AssertionError: expected "bound dispatchEvent" to be called
Number of calls: 0
```

**Root Cause:** Store actions not updating state as expected, possibly:
- Store implementation changed but tests not updated
- React hooks testing setup issue
- State update batching not handled in tests

## Coverage Analysis Status

### ❌ Coverage Report Not Generated

**Expected:**
- Vitest coverage report with v8 provider
- Coverage percentage by file/directory
- Uncovered lines report
- HTML coverage viewer

**Actual:**
- No `coverage/` directory found in project root
- Coverage data not collected due to test failures
- Cannot determine actual code coverage percentage

**Reason:**
With 92.2% test failure rate, Vitest did not generate coverage report. Coverage is only meaningful when tests pass successfully.

---

## Comparison: Backend vs Frontend

| Metric | Backend | Frontend | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Test Pass Rate** | 100% (543/543) ✅ | 7.8% (6/77) 🔴 | Backend much better |
| **Coverage Measured** | Yes (33%) ✅ | No ❌ | Backend has data |
| **Integration Tests** | All passing ✅ | All failing 🔴 | Backend isolated properly |
| **Test Infrastructure** | Mature ✅ | Modern but broken 🔴 | Frontend needs fixes |
| **API Mocking** | Built-in fixtures ✅ | None ❌ | Frontend needs MSW |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: No API Mocking Strategy 🔴 CRITICAL

**Problem:**
- Integration tests make real HTTP calls to `localhost:8000`
- No mock server or request interception
- Tests fail if backend not running

**Impact:** 50+ tests fail (API contracts, security, integration)

**Solution Needed:**
1. Install MSW (Mock Service Worker)
2. Create API mocks for all backend endpoints
3. Configure Vitest to use MSW handlers
4. Update tests to work in isolation

**Effort:** 8-12 hours
- 2h: MSW setup and configuration
- 4h: Create mock handlers for all API endpoints
- 2h: Update existing tests to use mocks
- 2h: Verify all tests pass

### Issue 2: Store Tests Out of Sync 🟡 MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- Multi-chart store implementation changed
- Tests not updated to match new behavior
- State updates not triggering correctly in test environment

**Impact:** 4 store tests failing

**Solution Needed:**
1. Review `multiChart.test.tsx` against current store implementation
2. Update assertions to match actual behavior
3. Fix React hooks testing setup (renderHook, act)
4. Ensure state updates are properly awaited

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
- 2h: Analyze store implementation vs tests
- 2h: Update test expectations
- 1h: Fix async state update handling
- 1h: Verify and document

### Issue 3: No Test Isolation 🟡 MEDIUM

**Problem:**
- Tests depend on external services (backend API)
- No separation between unit and integration tests
- E2E tests mixed with unit tests in same runs

**Impact:** Cannot run tests independently, CI/CD unreliable

**Solution Needed:**
1. Split tests into unit (isolated) and integration (backend required)
2. Create separate test scripts
3. Configure CI to run unit tests always, integration tests conditionally
4. Add documentation for local development testing

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

## Critical Path to Fix Frontend Tests

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (4-6 hours) ⭐ IMMEDIATE

**Goal:** Get 50+ tests passing by adding API mocking

**Tasks:**
1. Install MSW: `npm install -D msw`
2. Create `tests/mocks/handlers.ts` with API endpoints:
   ```typescript
   import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

   export const handlers = [
     http.post('http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login', () => {
       return HttpResponse.json({ token: 'mock-jwt-token' })
     }),
     http.get('http://localhost:8000/api/health', () => {
       return HttpResponse.json({ status: 'ok' })
     }),
     http.get('http://localhost:8000/api/ohlc/:symbol/:timeframe', () => {
       return HttpResponse.json({
         data: [
           { time: 1000, open: 100, high: 110, low: 90, close: 105, volume: 1000 }
         ]
       })
     }),
   ]
   ```
3. Create `tests/mocks/server.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
   import { handlers } from './handlers'

   export const server = setupServer(...handlers)
   ```
4. Update `vitest.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       setupFiles: ['./tests/setup.ts'],
     },
   })
   ```
5. Create `tests/setup.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll } from 'vitest'
   import { server } from './mocks/server'

   beforeAll(() => server.listen())
   afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
   afterAll(() => server.close())
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- API contract tests: 0% → 80% passing (10/12 tests)
- Security tests: 0% → 100% passing (12/12 tests)
- Integration tests: 0% → 60% passing (3/5 tests)
- **Total pass rate: 7.8% → 50%+**

### Phase 2: Fix Store Tests (4-6 hours)

**Goal:** Update store tests to match current implementation

**Tasks:**
1. Read `useMultiChartStore` implementation
2. Update `multiChart.test.tsx` assertions
3. Fix React hooks testing patterns
4. Ensure proper state update awaiting

**Expected Result:**
- Store tests: 0% → 100% passing (4/4 tests)
- **Total pass rate: 50% → 55%+**

### Phase 3: Test Isolation (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Separate unit and integration tests

**Tasks:**
1. Create `tests/unit/` (isolated tests, no backend)
2. Create `tests/integration/` (requires backend)
3. Update package.json scripts:
   ```json
   {
     "test:unit": "vitest run tests/unit tests/lib tests/types",
     "test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration tests/api",
     "test:e2e": "playwright test tests/e2e tests/visual tests/a11y"
   }
   ```
4. Document testing strategy

**Expected Result:**
- Clear test separation
- CI can run unit tests independently
- Integration tests only run when backend available

### Phase 4: Coverage Analysis (2 hours)

**Goal:** Measure actual frontend code coverage

**Prerequisites:** Phases 1-3 complete (70%+ tests passing)

**Tasks:**
1. Run `npm run test:coverage` with passing tests
2. Generate HTML coverage report
3. Identify uncovered critical files
4. Create frontend coverage improvement plan

**Expected Output:**
- Coverage percentage (predicted: 35-45%)
- Coverage gaps in critical files
- Prioritized improvement plan

## Predicted Coverage After Fixes

Based on test distribution and typical frontend coverage patterns:

| Category | Predicted Coverage | Confidence |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Components** | 40-50% | Medium (5 tests for many components) |
| **Stores** | 60-70% | High (dedicated store tests) |
| **Utils/Lib** | 70-80% | High (good unit test coverage) |
| **Types** | 90-100% | High (type tests passing) |
| **API Clients** | 30-40% | Low (contract tests, not implementation) |
| **Hooks** | 20-30% | Low (limited hook testing) |
| **Pages** | 10-20% | Low (mostly E2E tested) |
| **Overall** | **35-45%** | Medium |

**Comparison to Backend:**
- Backend: 33% actual coverage
- Frontend: 35-45% predicted (after fixes)
- **Similar range**, both need improvement to 80% target

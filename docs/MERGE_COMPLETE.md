## 📝 Detailed Plan for Task 4

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/re-enable-integration-tests
```

### Step 2: Analyze Current State
- [ ] Review `.github/workflows/integration-ci.yml.disabled`
- [ ] Check Docker Compose files
- [ ] Identify broken paths
- [ ] List all dependencies

### Step 3: Fix Paths
Update all paths in integration-ci.yml:
```yaml
# Before:
- run: cd frontend && npm install

# After:
- run: cd apps/frontend && npm install
```

### Step 4: Fix Docker Configuration
Update docker-compose commands:
```yaml
# Before:
docker-compose up -d

# After:
docker-compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Step 5: Test Locally
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Run integration tests
cd apps/backend
pytest tests/integration/ -v

cd ../frontend
npm run test:integration
```

### Step 6: Fix Tests
- Update API endpoints (add /api prefix if needed)
- Fix import paths
- Update test configurations
- Add missing environment variables

### Step 7: Re-enable in CI/CD
```bash
# Rename file
mv .github/workflows/integration-ci.yml.disabled .github/workflows/integration-ci.yml

# Update unified pipeline to include integration job
```

### Step 8: Verify
- [ ] Push branch
- [ ] Create PR
- [ ] Verify CI/CD passes
- [ ] Merge to main

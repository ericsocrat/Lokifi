# Asset Icons & Prices - Quick Summary

## ✅ Issue 1: Asset Icons - SOLVED

**Status**: Icons are **ALREADY FULLY IMPLEMENTED** in the modal!

Every asset shows:
- Company logos (stocks) from Clearbit API
- Cryptocurrency icons from CoinGecko API  
- Fallback to circular badge with initials

**Where**: Both in asset selection (Step 2) and quantity input (Step 3)

## ⚠️ Issue 2: Prices - Demo Data

**Status**: Using **simulated prices** for demo purposes

The prices you see (like BTC at $67k) are from `marketData.ts` - a simulated data source for development/demo.

**Demo Notice Added**: Blue info banner now appears in modal explaining this

## How to Fix Prices

### For Real Market Data:

**Crypto** (Free!):
```bash
# Use CoinGecko API - no key needed
fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin&vs_currencies=usd')
```

**Stocks**:
```bash
# Backend: Install yahoo-finance2
npm install yahoo-finance2
```

See `ASSET_ICONS_AND_PRICES_STATUS.md` for complete implementation guide.

# 🚀 CI/CD Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025
**Pipeline Status:** ✅ Active and Operational

---

## 📋 Overview

The Lokifi project has a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. Every push and PR triggers automated testing, security scanning, quality checks, and documentation deployment.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### On Every Push & Pull Request:

1. **🧪 Test Job** (~2 min)
   - Runs all Vitest tests with coverage
   - Uploads coverage reports as artifacts
   - Comments PRs with detailed coverage table

2. **🔒 Security Job** (~1 min)
   - Scans for vulnerabilities with npm audit
   - Blocks PRs with critical security issues
   - Comments PRs with vulnerability summary

3. **🎯 Quality Gate** (~10s)
   - Verifies all tests passed
   - Verifies security checks passed
   - Blocks merge if standards not met

### On Main Branch Pushes Only:

4. **📚 Documentation Job** (~1.5 min)
   - Generates test, API, and component documentation
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically
   - Keeps documentation always current

**Total Pipeline Time:** ~5 minutes (37% faster than target!)

## 💬 PR Comments

When you open a PR, you'll automatically get two comments:

### Test Results Comment
```markdown
## 🧪 Test Results

**Status:** ✅ Tests completed

### Coverage Report

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage   # Run with coverage
```bash

### Run Security Scan Locally
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm audit               # Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit fix          # Fix vulnerabilities automatically
```bash

### Generate Documentation Locally
```bash
.\lokifi.ps1 doc-generate    # Generate all documentation
.\lokifi.ps1 doc-test        # Generate test documentation only
.\lokifi.ps1 doc-api         # Generate API documentation only
.\lokifi.ps1 doc-component   # Generate component documentation only
```bash

### Use AI Test Tools
```bash
.\lokifi.ps1 test-smart      # AI-powered smart test selection
.\lokifi.ps1 test-suggest    # Get AI test suggestions
.\lokifi.ps1 test-trends     # View test trends over time
.\lokifi.ps1 test-impact     # Analyze test impact
```bash

### View Coverage Dashboard
```bash
.\lokifi.ps1 test-dashboard  # Interactive HTML dashboard
```bash

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Developers
1. ✅ Run tests locally before pushing
2. ✅ Use `lokifi.ps1 test-smart` for quick feedback
3. ✅ Review PR comments from CI/CD
4. ✅ Fix security vulnerabilities promptly
5. ✅ Keep dependencies updated

### For Reviewers
1. ✅ Check that all CI/CD jobs passed
2. ✅ Review coverage changes
3. ✅ Verify security scan results
4. ✅ Ensure quality gate passed
5. ✅ Check artifact reports if needed

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail in CI but Pass Locally
- Check Node.js version (CI uses Node 20)
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check for environment-specific code

### Security Job Fails
- Run `npm audit` locally
- Fix critical vulnerabilities: `npm audit fix`
- May need to update dependencies

### Quality Gate Blocked
- Ensure all tests pass
- Ensure security checks pass
- Check workflow logs for details

### Documentation Not Deploying
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled
- Check that gh-pages branch exists
- Review documentation job logs

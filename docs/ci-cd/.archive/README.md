## üìú History

### Pre-Optimization Era (Before PR #27)

**Workflow Architecture**:
- `lokifi-unified-pipeline.yml` - Monolithic 1,034-line workflow (archived)
- `integration-ci.yml` - Integration tests (replaced by integration.yml)
- 10+ other workflows (consolidated into 11 optimized workflows)

**Performance**:
- Average pipeline time: 17 minutes
- Simple changes: 17 minutes (no path detection)
- Redundant dependency installs
- No caching for Playwright browsers

### Post-Optimization Era (PR #27 - October 23, 2025)

**New Workflow Architecture**:
- `ci.yml` - Fast Feedback Loop (3 min)
- `coverage.yml` - Coverage Tracking (5-6 min)
- `integration.yml` - Integration Tests (8 min)
- `e2e.yml` - E2E Tests (6-15 min progressive)
- `security-scan.yml` - Security Scanning (5-10 min)
- 6 automation workflows (labels, size checks, stale management, etc.)

**Performance Improvements**:
- **82% faster** for simple changes (17 min ‚Üí 3 min)
- **Smart path detection** (only run affected tests)
- **Comprehensive caching** (Playwright browsers, Docker layers, npm/pip)
- **Progressive testing** (critical path first, full suite on main)

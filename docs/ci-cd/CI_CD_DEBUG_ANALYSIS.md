# CI/CD Debug Analysis - PR #20

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Issue:** All checks failing after 3-7 seconds
**PR:** https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/pull/20

## Current Status

### Our 3 Checks (Test & Quality Pipeline)
- ‚ùå üß™ Test & Coverage - Failing after 3s
- ‚ùå üîí Security Scan - Failing after 3s
- ‚ùå üéØ Quality Gate - Failing after 7s

### Fix Applied
‚úÖ **Node Version Fix:** Changed from "20" to "22"
- Commit: `8272e170`
- Branch: `test-ci-cd`
- Status: Pushed to GitHub

## Likely Causes (in order of probability)

### 1. Cache Path Issue (MOST LIKELY)
**Problem:** The cache path might not be resolving correctly in GitHub Actions.

```yaml
cache: "npm"
cache-dependency-path: apps/frontend/package-lock.json
```yaml

**Evidence:**
- Failing after 3-7 seconds = during dependency installation
- All 3 jobs fail (they all depend on npm ci succeeding)

**Solution:** Try absolute path or remove cache temporarily:
```yaml
# Option A: Use absolute path from repo root
cache-dependency-path: ./apps/frontend/package-lock.json

# Option B: Remove cache temporarily to test
# (comment out both cache lines)
```yaml

### 2. Working Directory + Checkout Issue
**Problem:** Files might not be in expected location after checkout.

**Current Setup:**
```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: apps/frontend

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      cache-dependency-path: apps/frontend/package-lock.json
```yaml

**Issue:** `setup-node` runs in root directory, but expects `apps/frontend/package-lock.json`

**Solution:** Either:
- A) Use absolute path: `${{ github.workspace }}/apps/frontend/package-lock.json`
- B) Remove working-directory default, use explicit paths

### 3. npm ci Strict Mode Issue
**Problem:** npm ci is more strict than npm install.

**Could fail if:**
- package-lock.json is out of sync with package.json
- package-lock.json has local file:// dependencies
- lockfileVersion incompatibility

**Solution:**
```bash
# Locally verify:
cd apps/frontend
npm ci --loglevel verbose
```bash

### 4. GitHub Actions Permissions
**Problem:** Workflow might lack necessary permissions.

**Missing in workflow:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write  # Needed for PR comments
  checks: write         # Needed for check annotations
```yaml

**Solution:** Add permissions at job or workflow level.

### 5. Node 22 + npm 11 Availability
**Problem:** GitHub Actions runner might not have Node 22 yet.

**Check:**
- Node 22 was released April 2024
- Should be available in `ubuntu-latest`
- But might need explicit `node-version: '22.x'` format

## Quick Fix Priority

### Fix #1: Add Workflow Permissions ‚ö° **TRY THIS FIRST**
```yaml
name: Test & Quality Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

permissions:  # ADD THIS
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write

env:
  NODE_VERSION: "22"
  COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 10
```yaml

### Fix #2: Remove Cache Temporarily
```yaml
- name: üì¶ Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    # cache: "npm"  # COMMENT OUT
    # cache-dependency-path: apps/frontend/package-lock.json  # COMMENT OUT
```yaml

### Fix #3: Use Absolute Cache Path
```yaml
cache-dependency-path: ${{ github.workspace }}/apps/frontend/package-lock.json
```yaml

### Fix #4: Change Node Version Format
```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: "22.x"  # Instead of "22"
```yaml

## How to Test Each Fix

### Method 1: Commit and Push (tests on GitHub)
```powershell
# Edit .github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml
git add .github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml
git commit -m "fix(ci): add workflow permissions and fix cache path"
git push
# Wait 3-5 minutes, check PR #20
```powershell

### Method 2: Local Verification
```powershell
# Test npm ci works locally
cd apps/frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm ci --loglevel verbose

# If it fails, check:
npm --version  # Should be >=11.0.0
node --version # Should be >=22.0.0
```powershell

## Recommended Action Plan

**Step 1:** Add permissions block (Fix #1)
**Step 2:** Remove cache temporarily (Fix #2)
**Step 3:** Commit and push
**Step 4:** Wait for results

If still failing:
**Step 5:** Check GitHub Actions logs in browser
**Step 6:** Look for specific error message
**Step 7:** Apply targeted fix based on error

## Expected Timeline

- **0:00** - Push fix
- **0:10** - GitHub detects push, queues workflows
- **0:30** - Workflows start running
- **3:00** - If still failing at 3s mark, it's a setup issue
- **5:00** - If jobs complete, SUCCESS! ‚úÖ

## How to Read GitHub Actions Logs

1. Go to PR #20: https://github.com/ericsocrat/Lokifi/pull/20
2. Click "Details" next to failing check
3. Expand each step to see logs
4. Look for:
   - Red ‚ùå next to failed step
   - Error messages in red text
   - "Error:", "Failed:", "ENOENT", "permission denied"

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 3 checks pass:
- Test & Coverage: ~2 minutes
- Security Scan: ~1 minute
- Quality Gate: ~10 seconds

This document establishes the test coverage baseline for the Lokifi project. Coverage metrics help track code quality and identify areas needing additional tests.

## üìä Overall Coverage Summary

| Component | Lines | Branches | Functions | Statements |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | 11.61% | 88.7% | 84.69% | 11.61% |
| **Backend** | 26.65% | N/A | N/A | 26.65% |

## üéØ Frontend Coverage (Apps/Frontend)

**Test Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @vitest/coverage-v8  
**Total Tests**: 2,542 passing, 15 skipped  
**Test Files**: 96 files  
**Execution Time**: ~50 seconds

### Detailed Metrics

```

Statements: 11.61%
```

### Coverage Highlights

**‚úÖ Well-Covered Areas**:

- Function coverage at 84.69% shows most functions are exercised
- Component tests are comprehensive with good happy path coverage

**‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Improvement**:
- Overall line coverage at 11.61% is low
- Statement coverage needs expansion
- 102 HIGH priority coverage gaps identified
- Edge cases and error paths need more tests

## üêç Backend Coverage (Apps/Backend)

**Test Framework**: Pytest with pytest-cov  
**Total Tests**: 761 collected (after duplicate fix)  
**Test Structure**: Fixed duplicate test file naming  
**Execution Time**: ~5 seconds (collection)

### Detailed Metrics

```
Statements: 26.65% coverage
Total Statements: ~15,000 (estimated)
Covered Statements: ~4,000
```

### Test Distribution

```
API Tests:       tests/api/ (alerts, chat, crypto, fmp, etc.)
Unit Tests:      tests/unit/ (now with _unit suffix)
Service Tests:   tests/services/ (now with _service suffix)
Integration:     tests/integration/ (if present)
```

### Recent Fixes

**‚úÖ Duplicate Test File Resolution**:
- Renamed 9 duplicate test files to resolve pytest collection errors
- Added `_unit` suffix to tests/unit/ files (7 files)
- Added `_service` suffix to tests/services/ files (2 files)
- Now successfully collecting 761 tests without conflicts

## üìà Coverage Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Frontend line coverage: 11.61% ‚Üí 30%
- [ ] Backend statement coverage: 26.65% ‚Üí 40%
- [ ] Document high-priority uncovered code paths
- [ ] Add tests for critical business logic

### Medium-term Goals (1 month)
- [ ] Frontend line coverage: 30% ‚Üí 50%
- [ ] Backend statement coverage: 40% ‚Üí 60%
- [ ] Achieve 90%+ branch coverage (frontend already at 88.7%)
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright

### Long-term Goals (3 months)
- [ ] Frontend line coverage: 50% ‚Üí 70%
- [ ] Backend statement coverage: 60% ‚Üí 80%
- [ ] Maintain 90%+ branch and function coverage
- [ ] Automate coverage tracking in CI/CD

## üîç Coverage Improvement Strategy

### 1. Prioritize High-Value Tests

Focus on:
- **Business Logic**: Core trading, portfolio, alerts functionality
- **API Endpoints**: Authentication, data fetching, WebSocket connections
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases, network failures, validation errors
- **Security-Critical Paths**: Auth, data validation, input sanitization

### 2. Test Quality Over Quantity

Write tests that:
- Test **behavior**, not implementation
- Cover **edge cases** and error scenarios
- Are **maintainable** and self-documenting
- Run **quickly** (unit tests < 1s, integration < 5s)

### 3. Smart Test Selection

Use tools to run only relevant tests:
```bash
# Frontend - run only changed files' tests
.\tools\test-runner.ps1 -Smart

# Frontend - run full suite before commit
.\tools\test-runner.ps1 -PreCommit

# Backend - run specific test file
pytest tests/api/test_auth.py -v
```

## üìã Coverage Tracking

### How to Generate Coverage Reports

#### Frontend
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML report
npx serve coverage-dashboard

# Check specific metrics
cat coverage-dashboard/data.json
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd apps/backend
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# View HTML report
cd htmlcov && python -m http.server 8080
```

### Automated Coverage Tracking

Coverage is automatically tracked in:
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (when configured)
- Pre-commit hooks (optional)
- Coverage dashboard trends (`coverage-dashboard/trends.json`)

## üé® Coverage Visualization

### Frontend Coverage Dashboard

The frontend includes a sophisticated coverage dashboard that shows:
- **Overall Coverage**: Lines, branches, functions, statements
- **File-level Details**: Individual file coverage with color coding
- **Trends**: Historical coverage changes over time
- **Gap Analysis**: High/medium/low priority coverage gaps
- **Velocity Tracking**: Coverage improvement rate

**Access**: Open `apps/frontend/coverage-dashboard/index.html` in a browser

### Backend Coverage HTML Report

Standard pytest-cov HTML report showing:
- Line-by-line coverage highlighting
- Branch coverage details
- Missing line indicators
- Coverage percentage per file

**Generate**: `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html`

## üö¶ Coverage Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Requirements

Before merging PRs:
- [ ] No decrease in overall coverage percentage
- [ ] New code has >80% coverage
- [ ] Critical paths have >90% coverage
- [ ] All tests passing (no skipped critical tests)

### Coverage Thresholds

Set in configuration files:
- **Frontend**: `vitest.config.ts` (coverage.thresholds)
- **Backend**: `pytest.ini` or `.coveragerc`

Example thresholds:
```javascript
// vitest.config.ts
coverage: {
  lines: 30,      // Minimum 30% line coverage
  branches: 80,   // Minimum 80% branch coverage
  functions: 80,  // Minimum 80% function coverage
  statements: 30  // Minimum 30% statement coverage
}
```

## üìä Historical Context

### Previous Coverage (Before Optimization)
- Backend: **26.65%** (established Oct 22, 2025)
- Frontend: **Not tracked** (baseline established Oct 23, 2025)

### Optimization Impact
- Fixed frontend test setup issues
- Resolved backend duplicate test file conflicts
- Established comprehensive coverage tracking
- Created interactive coverage dashboard

## üìù Notes

### Known Issues
- Frontend line coverage appears low due to large codebase (~38,895 lines)
- Branch and function coverage are excellent (88.7% and 84.69%)
- Backend has one import error in `test_follow_notifications_unit.py` (missing module)

### Recommendations
1. **Focus on line coverage improvement** - Add tests for uncovered code paths
2. **Maintain high branch coverage** - Continue testing conditional logic thoroughly
3. **Document test gaps** - Use coverage dashboard to identify priority areas
4. **Automate coverage tracking** - Integrate with CI/CD for trend monitoring

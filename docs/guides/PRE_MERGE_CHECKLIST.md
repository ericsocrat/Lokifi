2. **Merge PR #23 SECOND** (API Contract Testing)
   - Reason: More complex, more changes
   - Status: Ready now
   - Risk: Low (all issues resolved)

### After Merge
1. Delete feature branches:
   - `feature/visual-regression-testing`
   - `feature/api-contract-testing`

2. Update local main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Verify main pipeline:
   - Check CI/CD runs successfully
   - Verify coverage maintained
   - Confirm no regressions

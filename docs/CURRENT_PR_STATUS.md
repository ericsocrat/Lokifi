# Current PR Status & Action Plan

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**PR:** Re-enable Integration Tests (Task 4)
**Branch:** feature/re-enable-integration-tests

---

## ✅ Good News: Our PR is NOT Affected

### Why PR#23 Issues Won't Impact Us

**Issue 1: Documentation Deployment Failure ❌**
- ❌ PR#23 uses: `lokifi-unified-pipeline.yml` → has Generate Documentation job
- ✅ Our PR uses: `integration-ci.yml` → NO documentation job
- **Result:** ✅ No impact

**Issue 2: Backend Coverage Upload Warning ⚠️**
- ❌ PR#23 uses: `lokifi-unified-pipeline.yml` → uploads coverage.xml artifact
- ✅ Our PR uses: `integration-ci.yml` → NO coverage upload
- **Result:** ✅ No impact

### Our Workflow Scope

**integration-ci.yml only does:**
1. ✅ Build Docker images (frontend + backend)
2. ✅ Start services with docker-compose
3. ✅ Wait for health checks
4. ✅ Test endpoints
5. ✅ Run frontend integration tests
6. ✅ Show logs on failure
7. ✅ Cleanup

**NO coverage reports, NO documentation generation** → Clean and focused!

## 🎯 Expected CI Results for Current PR

### Should Pass ✅

```
✅ Integration CI
   ├── ✅ Checkout code
   ├── ✅ Set up Docker Buildx
   ├── ✅ Set up Node.js
   ├── ✅ Build Frontend Image (~2-3 min)
   ├── ✅ Build Backend Image (~2-3 min)
   ├── ✅ Create environment file
   ├── ✅ Start Services
   ├── ✅ Wait for Services to be Ready
   ├── ✅ Test Health Endpoints
   ├── ✅ Show Service Status
   ├── ⚠️ Run Frontend Integration Tests (may warn if no tests)
   └── ✅ Cleanup
```

**Total Expected Time:** 5-8 minutes

## 🔍 What to Monitor

### 1. Docker Build Steps (Most Likely to Fail)

**Watch for:**
- ❌ "context not found" → Path issue
- ❌ "Dockerfile: no such file" → Path issue
- ❌ "COPY failed" → Missing files in context
- ❌ Build timeout → Large image sizes

**If fails:**
- Check Dockerfile paths are correct
- Verify all COPY commands have valid sources
- Review build context includes needed files

---

### 2. Service Startup (Second Most Likely)

**Watch for:**
- ❌ "timeout waiting for backend health" → Backend not starting
- ❌ "timeout waiting for frontend" → Frontend not starting
- ❌ "postgres: connection refused" → DB not ready
- ❌ "redis: connection refused" → Redis not ready

**If fails:**
- Check service logs in "Show service logs on failure" step
- Verify docker-compose.yml configuration
- Check environment variables are correct
- Verify health check endpoints exist

---

### 3. Health Endpoint Tests (Third Check)

**Watch for:**
- ❌ "Backend health check failed with status 404" → Wrong endpoint path
- ❌ "Backend health check failed with status 500" → Backend error
- ❌ "Frontend check failed with status 502" → Proxy error

**If fails:**
- Verify `/api/health` endpoint exists in backend
- Check frontend proxy configuration
- Review CORS settings

---

### 4. Frontend Integration Tests (Expected Warning)

**Current behavior:**
```bash
npm run test:ci || echo "⚠️ Frontend tests not configured yet"
```

**Expected:**
- ⚠️ May show warning (non-blocking)
- ✅ Step will pass regardless
- 📝 We'll add actual tests in future tasks

## 🚨 If CI Fails

### Quick Triage Commands

**Check current PR CI status:**
```bash
# Check if PR is open
git branch -a | grep feature/re-enable-integration-tests

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

**Local debugging:**
```bash
# Test Docker build
docker build -t test-frontend apps/frontend
docker build -t test-backend apps/backend

# Test services
docker compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml ps
docker compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml logs

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/

# Cleanup
docker compose -f apps/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

## 📞 Questions to Ask When Monitoring

1. **Did Docker builds complete?** → Check duration (~2-3 min each)
2. **Did services start?** → Look for "✅ Backend is ready!" messages
3. **Did health checks pass?** → Check for "✅ Backend health: OK"
4. **Any red X marks?** → Investigate specific step failure
5. **Any warnings?** → Note but don't panic (frontend tests expected)

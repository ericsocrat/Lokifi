## 🔥 Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### Issue #1: Drawing Tools Not Functioning

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status**: 🔍 **INVESTIGATING**
**Component**: Frontend - Chart Drawing Tools

**Problem**:

- Clicking on drawing tools does not activate drawing mode
- Cannot draw lines, shapes, or annotations on charts
- Tool selection not registering clicks

**Expected Behavior**:

- User clicks a drawing tool (line, shape, etc.)
- Tool becomes active (visual feedback)
- User can draw on chart canvas
- Drawing persists on chart

**Actual Behavior**:

- No response when clicking drawing tools
- No visual feedback
- Cannot interact with chart for drawing

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Open app at http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to chart view
3. Click any drawing tool in toolbar
4. Try to draw on chart
5. Result: Nothing happens

**Affected Files (Suspected)**:

- `frontend/components/ChartPanelV2.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/DrawingTools.tsx` (if exists)
- `frontend/src/lib/drawings.ts`
- Chart library integration code

**Potential Causes**:

- [ ] Event listeners not attached
- [ ] State management issue (tool selection not updating)
- [ ] Chart library integration broken
- [ ] TypeScript type casting issues (we added `as any` during rebranding)
- [ ] React component lifecycle issue

**Fix Priority**: 🔥 **URGENT** - Core feature

### Issue #2: Search Functionality Broken

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status**: 🔍 **INVESTIGATING**
**Component**: Frontend - Search/Symbol Selection

**Problem**:

- Searching for different coins or stocks shows no results
- Search dropdown doesn't populate
- Cannot switch between different assets/symbols

**Expected Behavior**:

- User types in search box
- Dropdown shows matching symbols (stocks, crypto, forex)
- User selects symbol
- Chart updates with new symbol data

**Actual Behavior**:

- Search box accepts input
- No dropdown appears
- No results shown
- Cannot change symbols

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Open app
2. Locate symbol search box
3. Type "BTC" or "AAPL"
4. Result: No dropdown, no suggestions

**Affected Files (Suspected)**:

- `frontend/src/components/SearchBar.tsx` (if exists)
- `frontend/src/components/SymbolSearch.tsx` (if exists)
- API integration for symbol search
- Backend routes for search endpoints

**Potential Causes**:

- [ ] API endpoint not responding
- [ ] Frontend not calling API correctly
- [ ] CORS issue blocking requests
- [ ] Search state not updating
- [ ] Dropdown component not rendering

**Fix Priority**: 🔥 **URGENT** - Core feature

### Issue #3: Page Routing/Navigation Broken

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status**: 🔍 **INVESTIGATING**
**Component**: Frontend - Next.js Routing

**Problem**:

- Registration page not showing
- Profile pages not accessible
- Navigation between pages not working
- Pages may be missing or routes misconfigured

**Expected Behavior**:

- User can navigate to /register
- User can access profile at /profile
- All pages load correctly
- Navigation menu works

**Actual Behavior**:

- Certain pages don't load
- Navigation clicks don't go anywhere
- Missing pages or 404 errors

**Steps to Reproduce**:

1. Try to access http://localhost:3000/register
2. Try to access http://localhost:3000/profile
3. Click navigation menu items
4. Result: Pages don't load or navigation doesn't work

**Affected Files (Suspected)**:

- `frontend/src/app/` (Next.js 13+ app directory)
- `frontend/pages/` (if using pages directory)
- `frontend/src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Route configuration files

**Potential Causes**:

- [ ] Missing page files
- [ ] Incorrect Next.js routing setup
- [ ] Navigation component broken

### Issue #4: General Click Handler Issues

**Severity**: 🟡 **HIGH**
**Status**: 🔍 **INVESTIGATING**
**Component**: Frontend - Event Handlers

**Problem**:

- Multiple UI elements not responding to clicks
- Buttons not triggering actions

## 🔍 Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnostic (Current)

**Goal**: Understand what's broken and why

**Tasks**:

1. [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. [ ] Check Network tab for failed API calls
3. [ ] Review React DevTools for state issues
4. [ ] Test each component individually
5. [ ] Verify chart library is loaded
6. [ ] Check event listeners are attached

**Commands to Run**:

```powershell
# Start app with verbose logging
cd frontend
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
npm run dev

# Check for errors in console
# Open browser DevTools (F12)
# Monitor Console and Network tabs
```

---

### Phase 2: Component Analysis

**Goal**: Identify which files contain the bugs

**Focus Areas**:

1. **Drawing Tools**:

   - Check `ChartPanelV2.tsx`
   - Review chart library integration
   - Verify event handlers exist

2. **Search Component**:

   - Locate search component file
   - Check API endpoint connections
   - Verify dropdown rendering logic

3. **Routing**:
   - Review Next.js app structure
   - Check page files exist
   - Verify navigation component

**Code Review Checklist**:

- [ ] Are event handlers properly attached?
- [ ] Is state management working?
- [ ] Are API calls being made?
- [ ] Do components render correctly?
- [ ] Are there TypeScript errors we missed?

---

### Phase 3: Targeted Fixes

**Goal**: Fix each issue systematically

**Approach**:

1. Start with highest priority (drawing tools)
2. Fix one issue at a time
3. Test after each fix
4. Document solution
5. Commit working code

## 🛠️ Known Technical Debt

### Type Casting Issues

During rebranding, we added `as any` type casts in several places:

- `frontend/src/components/ShareBar.tsx` (line 18, 35)
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectBar.tsx` (line 19, 35)
- `frontend/components/ChartPanelV2.tsx` (line 388, 391)

**Impact**: Type safety compromised, potential runtime errors
**Action Needed**: Properly type these after fixing core issues

---

### Environment Variables

Current `.env` setup may not be loading correctly in all contexts.

**Files to Check**:

- `frontend/.env.local`
- `backend/.env`
- Environment variable loading in Next.js

## 🔧 Debugging Tools & Commands

### Check Frontend Console

```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
console.log("React version:", React.version);
console.log("Environment:", process.env.NODE_ENV);

// Check if chart library loaded:
console.log("TradingView:", typeof TradingView);
console.log("Lightweight Charts:", typeof window.LightweightCharts);
```

### Check Network Requests

```javascript
// In browser console:
// Check if API is reachable
fetch("http://localhost:8000/health")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((d) => console.log("Backend health:", d))
  .catch((e) => console.error("Backend error:", e));
```

### Check React State

```javascript
// Use React DevTools
// Components tab → Select component → View props/state
// Look for drawing tool state
// Look for search results state
```

### Backend Logs

```powershell
# Watch backend logs in terminal
# Look for:
# - Failed requests
# - CORS errors
# - 404s
# - 500 errors
```

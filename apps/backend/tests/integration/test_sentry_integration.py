Sentry Integration Tests

These tests verify that Sentry is properly configured and can capture errors.
Note: The before_send filter in main.py only sends ERROR and FATAL level events.

To run these tests:
1. Ensure ENABLE_SENTRY=true and SENTRY_DSN is set in .env
2. Run: pytest tests/integration/test_sentry_integration.py -v
3. Check Sentry dashboard to verify events were captured (for error-level tests)

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow (15 min)

**File:** `.github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml`

**Workflow Structure:**

```yaml
name: Test & Quality

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  security:
    name: Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  documentation:
    name: Generate Docs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

  quality-gate:
    name: Quality Gate
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]
```

#### Job 1: Test Job

```yaml
test:
  name: Run Tests & Coverage
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install dependencies

        npm run test:coverage

    - name: Upload coverage report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: apps/frontend/coverage/

    - name: Comment PR with results
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      uses: actions/github-script@v7
      with:
        script: |
          // Read coverage summary
          // Post comment to PR
```

#### Job 2: Security Job

```yaml
security:
  name: Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd apps/frontend
        npm ci

    - name: Run npm audit
      run: |
        cd apps/frontend
        npm audit --json > audit-results.json || true

    - name: Check for critical vulnerabilities
      run: |
        cd apps/frontend
        CRITICAL=$(jq '.metadata.vulnerabilities.critical' audit-results.json)
        if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
          echo "❌ Found $CRITICAL critical vulnerabilities"
          exit 1
        fi

    - name: Upload security report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: security-report
        path: apps/frontend/audit-results.json
```

#### Job 3: Documentation Job

```yaml
documentation:
  name: Generate & Deploy Docs
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd apps/frontend
        npm ci

    - name: Generate test documentation
      run: |
        cd apps/frontend
        npm run test -- --run
        # Use custom script to generate docs

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./docs
```

#### Job 4: Quality Gate

```yaml
quality-gate:
  name: Quality Gate
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test, security]
  steps:
    - name: Check quality standards
      run: |
        echo "✅ All quality checks passed!"
```

---

### Step 2: Add npm Scripts (5 min)

**File:** `apps/frontend/package.json`

Add scripts for CI/CD:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:ci": "vitest run --coverage",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "security:scan": "npm audit --json",
    "docs:generate": "echo 'Documentation generation placeholder'",
    "quality:check": "npm run test:ci && npm run security:scan"
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages (5 min)

**Steps:**

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Configure custom domain (optional)

---

### Step 4: Test the Workflow (5 min)

**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Push to branch:**

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/test-and-quality.yml
   git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create test PR:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-ci-workflow
   echo "test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: trigger CI workflow"
   git push -u origin test-ci-workflow
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - Check GitHub Actions tab
   - Verify all jobs run
   - Check PR comments
   - Download artifacts

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (from best practices)

### What Works Well

✅ **Matrix builds** - Test on multiple Node versions
✅ **Caching dependencies** - Faster workflow runs
✅ **Conditional jobs** - Only run what's needed
✅ **Artifacts** - Preserve reports for later
✅ **PR comments** - Immediate feedback

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

⚠️ **Long-running workflows** - Keep under 10 minutes
⚠️ **No caching** - Wastes time installing dependencies
⚠️ **Too strict gates** - Balance quality with velocity
⚠️ **No parallelization** - Run jobs in parallel

### Best Practices

💡 **Use official actions** - More reliable and maintained
💡 **Pin action versions** - Prevent breaking changes
💡 **Fail fast** - Stop workflow early on critical failures
💡 **Upload artifacts** - Preserve reports for debugging
💡 **Comment on PRs** - Give developers immediate feedback
